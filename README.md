# AChoir
Windows Live Artifacts Acquisition Scripting Framework

# Brief Description:
Every Incident Responder eventually comes to the conclusion that they need to 
script their favorite Live Acquisition utilities.

I have seen these scripts written in numerous scripting languages - but oddly 
enough, all of these scripts tend to use many of the same freely available 
utilities - To do mostly the same things.

It often takes an Incident Responder several years, along with lots of trial 
and error to settle on a set of utilities (and options) that both work and 
that provide relevant information on useful forensic artifacts.

And even though Responders often use the same utilities and are scripting them 
in largely the same way, each Responder has to go through the same pain of 
building their own script in their (not so) favorite scripting language - 
figuring out how to quickly and consistently gather the artifacts of most value. 

Achoir is a Framework/Scripting Tool to standardize and simplify that process.


# Quick Start (tl;dr):
The quickest way to get started with AChoir is to download the Achoir-Inst.exe 
file, run it, and allow it to build the default AChoir Toolkit.  

If you want to buid the toolkit onto an external USB drive, simply install Achoir 
to your external USB drive, and let the Install program run the build process 
from there.  Achoir will Install and build the toolkit onto the Drive and 
Directory it is installed to. This process also works if you want to install/run
AChoir from a network share.
